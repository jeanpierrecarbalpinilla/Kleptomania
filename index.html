    <img src="./img/car-g700e2a174_1280.jpg" alt="" id="causa"/>
    <p>Genetic Factors: There is evidence to suggest a genetic predisposition to kleptomania, as individuals with a family history of impulse control disorders may be more prone to developing this condition.</p>
    <p> Psychological Factors: Kleptomania can be linked to underlying psychological issues, such as depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem. Emotional distress and the need for emotional release may contribute to the urge to steal.</p>
    <p>Neurobiological Factors: Neurotransmitter imbalances, particularly involving serotonin, have been implicated in kleptomania. Disruptions in the brain's reward and impulse control systems may play a role in the development of this disorder.</p>

    <p>Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): CBT is a commonly used therapeutic approach for kleptomania. It helps individuals identify the thoughts and emotions that drive compulsive stealing behaviors and provides strategies to modify these patterns of thinking and behavior.</p>
    <p> Group Therapy Engaging in group therapy or support groups with others who share similar challenges can be beneficial for individuals with kleptomania. It offers a supportive environment for addressing underlying issues and reducing feelings of isolation</p>
    <p>  Medication: In some cases, medication such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be prescribed to help manage impulsive urges and alleviate symptoms of kleptomania.</p>
